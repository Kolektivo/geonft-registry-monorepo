## Requirements

Yarn

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kolektivo/geonft-registry-monorepo.git
cd geonft-registry-monorepo
yarn install
```

### Setup .env file for dapp

Create an Infura Account and an Infura project with IPFS Service, copy `packages/dapp/.env.sample` to `packages/dapp/.env` and fill in the following fields:

PROJECT_ID=

PROJECT_SECRET=

### Setup Metamask

To run locally, create a new profile in Chrome and open the Metamask plugin.

Import the test seed phrase: `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`

Under `Networks` click `Show/hide test networks`

Open Metamask `Settings`, `Networks`, and select `Localhost 8545`. Set chainId to `31337`

Select `Localhost 8545` network.

Notice: when running a Localhost node, you may receive this error: `Nonce too high. Expected nonce to be 1 but got N. Note that transactions can't be queued when automining.` As a fix, go to `Settings`, `Advanced`, and click `Reset Account`.

## Run

### Hardhat Local Node

Open a terminal and run `yarn hardhat:localnode`

### Run dapp

Open packages/dapp/webpack.config.js and update devServer...host with your local IP Address.

Open a second terminal and run `yarn dapp:start`

Open your Chrome profile with test Metamask instance and go to <https://YOURIPADDRESS:8080/>

### Wallet

1) Select Metamask and connect with the localhost node.
2) Select WalletConnect and scan the QR Code with your Alfajores wallet.
